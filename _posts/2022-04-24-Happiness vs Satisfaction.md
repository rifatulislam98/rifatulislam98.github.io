Allah mentioned in holy Quran, 
"Verily in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest." 13:28 -

Happiness is temporary feeling. You can earn money and live a rich life.But It's not just how much you make money that determines how satisfied you are with your life.

Whereas satisfaction is something that you have in your heart and you might feel happy at times and also sad at times  but you would still have that satisfaction in your heart. 

So we need to understand that happiness and satisfaction are different thing. By earning money,  fame etc you can find happiness over happiness but you will never find true satisfaction until and unless you do the one thing which your creator  has told you because your creator has designed you in that way.You're able to become satisfied Only by remembering Allah.
